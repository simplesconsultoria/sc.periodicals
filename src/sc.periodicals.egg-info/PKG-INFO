        ----------------------------------
        
        Periodicals in Plone are a folderish content type: they can contain a cover title,
        a description, a circulation date, a cover image and some basic metadata.
        And you can add `News article`_ content type to include articles in the periodical.
        
        Mostly Harmless

        sc.periodicals Installation
        ---------------------------
        
        To install sc.periodicals into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
        using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:
        
        * When you're reading this you have probably already run 
          ``easy_install sc.periodicals``. Find out how to install setuptools
          (and EasyInstall) here:
          http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall
        
        * If you are using Zope 2.9 (not 2.10), get `pythonproducts`_ and install it 
          via::
        
            python setup.py install --home /path/to/instance
        
        into your Zope instance.
        
        * Create a file called ``sc.periodicals-configure.zcml`` in the
          ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
          should only contain this::
        
            <include package="sc.periodicals" />
        
        .. _pythonproducts: http://plone.org/products/pythonproducts
        
        
        Alternatively, if you are using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
        recipe to manage your project, you can do this:
        
        * Add ``sc.periodicals`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:
        
            [buildout]
            ...
            eggs =
                ...
                sc.periodicals
               
        * Tell the plone.recipe.zope2instance recipe to install a ZCML slug:
        
            [instance]
            recipe = plone.recipe.zope2instance
            ...
            zcml =
                sc.periodicals
              
        * Re-run buildout, e.g. with:
        
            $ ./bin/buildout
                
        You can skip the ZCML slug if you are going to explicitly include the package
        from another package's configure.zcml file.

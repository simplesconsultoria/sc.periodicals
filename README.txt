Portlet
-------

It's possible to include a portlet to show the last periodical and its articles.
It's a very simple portlet. You just need to enter a name for header (optional).
Other information is not necessary.

The portlet will show the last published periodical and another 2 articles.
These articles should be published too. It will show the articles in the order
that appear in the periodical.

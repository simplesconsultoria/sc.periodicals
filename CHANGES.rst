Changelog
---------

  [rodfersou]

  [rodfersou]

  [rodfersou]

  [rodfersou]

- Remove hard dependency on plone.app.referenceablebehavior as Archetypes is no longer the default framework in Plone 5.
  Under Plone < 5.0 you should now explicitly add it to the `eggs` part of your buildout configuration to avoid issues while upgrading.

  [hvelarde]

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Registry resource folder. [cleberjsantos]


1.0a3 (2013-05-03)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  of 'weekday' from publication date. [hvelarde]


1.0a2 (2013-05-03)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- Use effective date instead of creation date for getting the latest
  periodical; still not optimal, but it probably will work better. [hvelarde]

  viewlet template (closes `#6`_). [hvelarde]

- A new rich text field was added to the Periodical content type. [hvelarde]

- Use 'preview' scale instead of 'mini' for image size in view template.
  [hvelarde]

- Remove dependency on unittest2 and fix package dependencies; tests could
  fail on Python 2.6; you have been warned. [hvelarde]

- Update Brazilian Portuguese and Spanish translations. [hvelarde]

- Remove unassociated template periodicals_list. [hvelarde]

- Do not allow discussion by default in Periodical content type. [hvelarde]

  listed on folder_summary_view. [ericof]
